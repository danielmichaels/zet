# Instant Motivation

Sat down to do some coding and was really struggling. Motivation was low, mood felt off
and defeatist.

Got off my arse and jumped on the assault bike for twenty.

What a motivator; did I want to do it? No but I knew it would be what got be out of
the func I was in.

Just workout people, its easy!
