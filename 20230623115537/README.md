# ngroks newer cousin

I just stumbled upon `jprq` a Ngrok alternative.

<https://github.com/azimjohn/jprq> 

To use it you need to authenticate using your Github account. This has the added side affect
of using your github username as the `jprq.live` subdomain.

For instance, mine is `danielmichaels.jprq.live`. This is much more user friendly than Nrgoks
randomly generated one.

Its written in Go as well.
